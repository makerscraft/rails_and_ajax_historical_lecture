# README

I've struggled with teaching the Ajax on Rails topic so I tried to capture my
best understanding and the understanding I try to impart to our students.  I'm
not sure if I'm teaching best practices here and I would like to try to
document things so that I can discuss my understanding.

I've tried very hard to build a coherent interpretation based on best practices
but I have never found a particularly compelling, holistic narrative.

I'm very open to feedback on this.
